    "\n",
    "The past several years have seen a sharp rise in e-commerce sales. Retail e-commerce sales reached $$3.53 trillion in 2019, and e-retail revenues are expected to reach $6.54 trillion by 2022, according to Statista. This huge increase suggests that consumers' purchasing habits have changed significantly. When compared to traditional sales, e-commerce has the distinct advantage that all transaction data, such as the goods, pricing, and shopping time, can be precisely recorded and saved. By grouping consumers into meaningful categories based on extensive transaction data, the firm may better understand the habits and preferences of its customers and meet their requirements more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhancing customer retention and corporate profitability requires an enterprise's capacity to recognize customer behavior and choose the right customer. Practical information about the product from the perspective of the client advantages anticipated gleaned from many connection between the business and its clients hasbeen taken prisoner. In order to increase client happiness and reduce operating expenses, combining comparable aspects of the Clients are vital. Furthermore, grouping clients also lessen the intricacy of the product's design. Consequently, comprehension Features of the customer allow the business to control the product organizing and creating goods that are appropriate for consumers. \n",

    "## Data and Sources\n",
    "This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The online shop that is the subject of this article is a registered non-store firm with 80 employees that is situated in the UK. The business was founded in 1981 and specializes in offering unusual presents for every occasion. The merchant used to take orders over the phone and mostly rely on direct mailing catalogs for many years. Just two years prior, the business established its own website and made the full transition to the internet. Since then, the business has maintained a consistent and healthy clientele from around Europe and the United Kingdom, and it has amassed a vast quantity of consumer data. Additionally, the business markets and sells its goods via Amazon.co.uk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 displays the 8 variables that make up the customer transaction dataset that the merchant owns. The dataset comprises all of the transactions that happened in the years 2010 and 2011. There were a total of 22,190 legitimate transactions throughout that time frame, linked to 4381 valid unique postcodes. The dataset contains 406 830 instances (record rows) that correspond to these transactions, each of which represents a specific item that was a part of a transaction. It should be mentioned that the variable PostCode is crucial to the operation of the company since it gives crucial information that identifies and tracks each individual customer, allowing for some in-depth analysis to be conducted in the current research.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, each postcode is associated with five transactions, that is, each customer has purchased a product from the online retailer about once every2 months. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, only consumers from the United Kingdom are analysed. It is interesting to notice that the average number of distinct products (items) contained in each transaction occurring in 2011 was 18.3 ( = 406 830 / 22 190). This seems to suggest that many of the consumers of the business were organizational customers rather than individual customers. \n"
